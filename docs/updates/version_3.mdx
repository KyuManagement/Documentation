## Update 3.0.2 | <Highlight>08/05/2022</Highlight>

As some of you may know Discord is planning on removing discriminators (# at the end of your username) soon. I've pushed out some updates to remove places where we used them, so rank cards might be looking a little bit different. There are also a bunch of random updates to fix bugs/embeds I can't remember.

Also watch out for some really cool updates coming on in the next few weeks ðŸ‘€

## Update 3.0.1 | <Highlight>08/04/2022</Highlight>

## Update 3.0.0-beta.3 | <Highlight>26/03/2022</Highlight>

**Kyu Imports**

Imports have now been finished and everything seems to be working pretty well. You might be wondering why make an announcement about just one feature being finished? Well imports was the last feature that needed to be finished. So, v3 should be realising very very soon :KyuHype:.

Over the next week I'm going to be testing every single feature to make sure everything is working properly and once done I'll be realising the NEW VERSION! I'm super hyped for what's to come, and we have a ton of things planned including some awesome events!!

- LOOTBOXES ARE FINALLY BACK
- Announcements have now been implemented
- 12 new variables for announcements

**Bug fixes**

- Command descriptions on the help page
- Adding a new badge caused interaction to fail
- Embed descriptions being incorrect
- Rank cards showing incorrect positions
- Users not being able to upload images for profile
- Exp not being rewarded properly
- Rewards not being assigned properly
- Rewards being assigned multiple times
- Blacklist not working as intended
- Ignore not working as intended
- Modifyexp not rewarding users properly

**Future updates**
I'm going to be away for the next week, so lets hope nothing crashes and burns as I won't have much access to the bot over this period. Once I'm back I will be mainly focusing on releasing v3 and possibly some new events :egg:... Until then let me know if you find any issues with the bot and have a great week :KyuLove:
