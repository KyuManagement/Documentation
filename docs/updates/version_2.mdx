## Help Kyu learn more languages | <Highlight>11/20/2022</Highlight>

As some of you may have seen, we now support multiple languages. Depending on the language you have set in Discord we change Kyu's embeds to that language. While we currently don't support many languages, we are planning on adding more languages and this is where you can help us. We have created a Github repository, where you can create a pull request to help Kyu learn new languages! We appreciate any help we can get for this project :KyuLove:! 

Current available languages:
- English
- French
- German
- Spanish

## Trick-or-Treat event | <Highlight>10/11/2022</Highlight>

#### Event release

<details>
  <summary>Trick-or-Treat event | <Highlight>10/11/2022</Highlight></summary>
  <div>
    <div>Welcome to the Halloween event, this is our first ever event and I decided to make it a PvP event. I've spent the past few days to make sure the event works well and hopefully is interesting, I'll be keeping an eye on the economy and may make some adjustments during the event. But for now we have some awesome features and rewards for the event.<br />
    The following commands have been added:<br />
    - /halloween treat - Go trick or treating and get candy :KyuCandy:<br />
    - /halloween trick @user - Steal candy from a user (with a chance of losing your own candy)<br />
    - /halloween leaderboard - Check candy global leaderboard<br />
    - /halloween claim - Claim the rewards for Halloween event<br />
    - /halloween lootbox - Feed your gambling addiction with lootboxes<br />
    <br />
    Rewards:
    - Halloween lootboxes :KyuCandy: - Rewards random amount of candy<br />
    - Halloween 2022 badge :KyuPumpkin: - Exclusive badge for this year's Halloween event<br />
    <br />
    <Highlight>Happy trick or treating</Highlight>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

#### Bugfix 1 

<details>
  <summary>Haloween bug fixes | <Highlight>10/11/2022</Highlight></summary>
  <div>
    <div>Fixed a few bugs to improve the Halloween event<br />
    
    - Both users now need to have 25 :KyuCandy: to do /halloween trick<br />
    - Buffed lootboxes and /halloween treat rewards<br />
    - Changed embed footers to have relative times (You can open lootbox in 5 minutes)<br />
    - Added /halloween reminder so the bot reminds you when timers are over now
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

#### Bugfix 2

<details>
  <summary>Halloween buffs | <Highlight>10/15/2022</Highlight></summary>
  <div>
    <div>I underestimated how long the current candy payout would actually take. So /halloween treat has had a major buff so at least some people can now get lootboxes/badges.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

#### Bugfix 3

<details>
  <summary>More Trick-or-Treat updates | <Highlight>10/16/2022</Highlight></summary>
  <div>
    <div>Lootboxes have been buffed a lot, along with /halloween treat. I wanted the event to be grindy but maybe it was a bit too much grindy. Will keep that in mind for the next event.
    Everyone has gotten 1 lootbox :KyuCrateHalloween: so hope it's good  :)    
    </div>

**Dashboard:** The dashboard is in the works again, while this isn't going to be released next week it is being worked on and I want to make sure it's easy to use and has a nice UI. While working on Kyu v2 the dashboard was put on hold but it's become my main focus again. Kyu International Read the post above and help Kyu learn new languages.

## Supporting translations | <Highlight>08/03/2022</Highlight>

Hey, I talked a bit about it in the last post but we're trying to make <Highlight>@KyuBot</Highlight> learn some new languages. I'd love to be able to just translate all these but I'm pretty dumb and only know barely two languages. So we're hoping you guys can help us create translations of the current commands for a variety of different languages.

I found Crowdin which makes translations a bit simpler (hopefully).

## Update 2.0.0 | <Highlight>08/02/2022</Highlight>

**KyuBot v2 is finally finished!**

The long awaited update is finally here.
Multiple language support - still need to translate them all
Better/more optimised system for amariimport and mee6import, you can now import from Tatsu bot.

- Test (Test custom announcements)

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Announce:</Highlight>

- Option to set description back to default

Variables:
- List of all available variables

Removed:

- Type (has been moved to it's own command)
- Embed (has been moved to it's own command)

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Embed:</Highlight>

Embeds have been improved MASSIVELY, and I want to introduce custom embeds and embeds for specific levels.

Add:

- Add a new embed for a specific level

Remove:

- Remove an embed from a specific level

Customize:

- Customize the title, description, image, and color for global announcements or specific level
- Set description to default for global announcements or specific level

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Import:</Highlight>

Another new command, well kinda... amariimport and mee6import have been combined into /import. Along with introducing imports from Tatsu.
Users can currently select to import from one of the following bots:

- AmariBot
- Mee6
- Tatsu

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Koth:</Highlight>

There hasn't been many updates with koth, but keep an eye out for some really cool stuff coming for this command soon. BUT, there has been one update, there's a MUCH nicer embed for when announcing koth winners. 


<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Reset:</Highlight>

Not many people use the reset command (one of the least used commands). Nevertheless, there have been a few updates to this command as a few users requested.

- You can now reset specific users, even if they have left the server.

You can now reset the following settings:

- Announce
- Blacklist
- Goodbye
- Ignore
- Koth
- Voice
- Welcome
- Points
- Settings


<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Rewards:</Highlight>

Not too many updates here yet, but rewards limit has now been upped from 25 to 30 roles. 

I'm still messing with this so it may decrease or increase randomly without any announcements.

Along with that there were some bugs with the rewards slash command where it wouldn't recognise the mentioned role, this has now been fixed. Also there's a better embed now :)

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Setlevel:</Highlight>

You can now update the level of multiple members, this is done by providing a level for all members which have a specific role.

This is still a bit buggy due to the way discord works (we can't get member roles until they send a message). I'm trying to figure out a way to improve this, so hopefully soon that issue will be fixed.


<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Test:</Highlight>

This might be removed but you can now use this command to test the global announcement or specific level announcements.

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Type:</Highlight>

Another new command for your cute face :). You can change where the announcements are sent/type of announcements sent.

You can select all announcements to be sent to a specific channel, only roles with rewards to be sent, announcements sent to user dms or sent in the channel where the user levels up.

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Voice:</Highlight>

Not much new here but there have been some nice embeds introduced for this, along with a bunch of bug fixes.

Also you can now check the leaderboard for voice levels.

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Leaderboard:</Highlight>

Leaderboard has not that many changes for you, but on the backend there has been many improvements and fixes.

But there are a few new features with leaderboards:

- All leaderboards are now paginated, so you can go through each page.
- Member's who have no experience are no longer shown on the leaderboard.
- If there are no members with experience the bot actually replies and tells you instead of creating dummy data.

You can now check the following leaderboards:

- Normal
- Voice
- Koth


<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Lootbox:</Highlight>

I love this command (mainly cause it feeds my addiction), but there are a few new features.
Stats:

- Check the total amount of lootboxes you have opened in the specific guild.
- Check how many lootboxes you have left until rare/gold lootbox

Open:

- Open a lootbox to earn experience
- New animations for lootboxes (WIP | Only available for donators)

Toggle:

- Server admins can now disable lootboxes for all members.

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Profile:</Highlight>

While there's no new features there are some UI improvements for this command.

Opacity:

- UI has been added which allows users to use buttons to change opacity and get live updates of what the opacity looks like.

Background & overlay:

- Mainly backend updates, but images are now compressed and resized to fit the current canvas size. So make sure you have the correct resolution for images.


<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Rank:</Highlight>

BADGES ARE FINALLY BACK, along with a few other updates which are pretty cool.
User:

- Fixed a lot of issues when users tried to check another users rank.
- You can no longer check the rank of a bot (I don't want bots in my database)

Type:

- You can now check experience for both normal and voice ranks 

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Givexp:</Highlight>

Not very cool stuff here but users will now be given roles when they reach a specific level that has rewards.

<Highlight color={"#d33d3d"} style={{fontWight: 'bold'}}>Removexp:</Highlight>

Again not very cool stuff here but when users lose a level and go under reward level, that role will be removed from the user.
