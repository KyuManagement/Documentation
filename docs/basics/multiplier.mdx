## Invite the bot

And now you have started earning exp. You can also import experience from various other bots using `/import`.

## Rewards

Our leveling system gives your members a chance to earn rewards for their activity in the server. You can use our rewards command to give users roles upon leveling up. Use `/rewards add 10 @KyuBot` assign any role to a specific level.

:::info

When setting up roles make sure that KyuBot's highest role is above the role you are trying to assign in the role hierarchy.

## Voice Experience

Members can also earn experience for talking in voice channels. Voice experience is currently in early development so it may not be as feature rich but we are actively working on it. To setup voice experience run `/voice setting enable`.

## Koth

In king of the hill members fight to earn rewards, only one can win. Members gain 1 experience per message with 60 seconds cooldown. Setup koth using `/koth setting start` and rewards can be setup using `/koth reward @KyuBot`.

## Custom Announcements

Announcements can be setup to be sent to a specific channel/type using `/type set default`. Furthermore, announcements are now fully customisable, you can change the title, description, image, and much. Using `/embed customise` you can change how the embed is presented, along with disabling embeds for announcements.

## Blacklist

Want to stop members from gaining experience from those spam channels? `/blacklist channel #general` can be used to stop members from gaining experience in specific channels. Roles can also be blacklisted using `/blacklist role @KyuBot`, any members with the blacklisted role will no longer gain experience.
