Due to recent announcements from <Highlight color="#69d9a1" url="https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps">Discord</Highlight> KyuBot has now strictly moved to `slash commands`. Slash commands still have all the awesome features, along with some extra features.

Make sure the bot has the following permissions for slash commands to work properly:

- Administrator

`or:`

- Attach Files
- Embed Links
- Manage Events
- Manage Guild
- Manage Messages
- Manage Roles
- Manage Webhooks
- Moderate Members
- Read Message History
- Send Messages
- Send Messages In Threads
- Use Application Commands
- Use External Emojis
- View Channel
