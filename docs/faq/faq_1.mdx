<Highlight color="#34ca68">Why is the bot called like that?</Highlight><br />

ðŸ š It was either Kyu or Nix.<br />
 Nix is a management OS (Bot was going to be a server manager first so I thought it would be cool to name it there).
 But then I decided to there's a lot of leveling bots missing ALOT of functions/users have too pay too much so I decided to do leveling bot.
 Then Kyusetzu messaged me and I was like that would a cool name for a bot so I decided to name it that.
