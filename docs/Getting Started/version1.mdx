## Website | <Highlight>04/04/2022</Highlight>

**WEBSITE IS LIVE**

I've spent wayyyy too long working today on the website but it's finally done. And looks moderately decent, let me know your thoughts. I will be updating it over this week if I find any bugs/responsive issues. 
Along with that the bot servers have been moved to new servers, so everything might be a little faster. I will hopefully try to get out another update this week and then I'm gonna take a few weeks off (going on a holiday). So if you have any bugs/issues right now would be the best time to let me know so I can fix those things before I leave. 
<InlineImage image={"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/944531800858972240.webp"} size={"18px"}>As always THANK YOU sooo much for all the support you guys have shown and lets keep on growing the bot</InlineImage>

I'll provide more information about that later on but for now lets get into this update.

**Feature updates**

**Bot Verification**

Applied for bot verification almost two weeks ago and we are still waiting for an answer from Discord. Sadly, not being verified has affected our growth quite a bit recently, so hopefully we'll get a response soon. But for those who can't invite the bot, we apologise for the inconvenience but currently it's just not in our hands and it's something we can't. 

**Future updates**

The future holds a lot in its hand. With all of the amazing support, I've been so motivated to work on the bot and it's future. Recently, I haven't been releasing many updates but soon we'll be releasing the first version of our dashboard. I'm trying my best right now to try make the dashboard super simple to understand and use. While there is much work to be done, the dashboard is super close to being complete.

## Update 1.3.2 | <Highlight>26/02/2022</Highlight>

I forgot to post this yesterday, but there's been a few updates this week. Nothing major right now but we have some really cool stuff coming soon.

**Feature updates**

> - Profile now accepts `colour` as well as `color`. 
> - Green color has now been added to profile. 
> - You can now test announcements using `k!announce test`
> - Changed the design for leaderboard embeds

**Bug fixes**

> - Issue where announcements were not being sent when set to default 
> - Issue with voice not sending any level up announcements 
> - `k!amariimport` errors when Amari hasn't been in the server 
> - Issue with leaderboard not showing for koth

**Future updates**

Currently I've been working a lot on the website/dashboard so there hasn't been many updates to the bot lately. Hopefully, soon we'll get back into a position of constant updates and feature release. Talking about feature releases, we're currently working on slash commands and are hoping to release them within the next 2 weeks.

## Update 1.3.1 | <Highlight>18/02/2022</Highlight>

It's been a slow week in all ends, but there have been a few bug fixes/feature updates. Most of them are rather small but nonetheless here's what I've been up to this week. 

**Feature updates**

> - Leaderboard embed has a nicer look, it shows the username now instead of mentioning user. This was mainly because mentioning users would show `@Invalid User`. 
> - Rank cards have now been updated to show the badge spots (And some members may already have a badge) 
> - Updated rank card for interaction commands

**Bug fixes**

> - Announcements for `koth` had issues not finding the correct channel 
> - `koth` announcements can only be sent to text channels. This is temporary, will be fixed in the future. 
> - When issues occur users will now get an embed stating the error. 
> - Stats embed now shows a bit more information and has an improved layout 
> - Users now get dm'd for voting 
> - A lot of backend boring fixes that don't really matter but yeah...

## Update 1.3.0 | <Highlight>11/02/2022</Highlight>

A lot of bug fixes this week, with one major feature release. While the new feature is rather basic, as time goes on I'll be adding a lot more to this feature.

**KOTH**

> - A temporary leaderboard which awards the top member a specific role.
> - Users earn 1 exp per message.
> - Cooldown is the same as normal exp.
> - Custom leaderboard for know `k!leaderboard koth`
> - Check out all the current features using `k!help koth`

**Feature updates**

> - Updated the font on rank cards, should be more clear now.
> - Added `Koth` to the leaderboard command
> - Updated stats command to show more information
> - Updated default prefixes, you can now ping @KyuBot and it counts as a prefix

**Bug fixes**

> - Fixed issue where `k!leaderboard` would reset cooldown for top 10 members
> - Fixed issue with user/guild icons not showing embeds
> - Voice from now going forward, counts how long you've spent in a channel

**Future updates**

Updates for this week are going to be pretty slow, I'm working on some stuff which will take a while to complete. So next week I'll be back to working on new features, but I think this week is mainly going to be bug fixes and small feature updates.

## Update 1.2.0 | <Highlight>04/02/2022</Highlight>

This week has been a bit of a slow week for the updates, I'm working on some big stuff I think everyone is gonna love. But nonetheless lets get into this weeks updates! 

**Reset**

Making it easier to reset guild settings. The following settings can be reset: 

> - Announce 
> - Blacklist 
> - Ignore 
> - Voice 
> - Goodbye 
> - Welcome 
> - Rewards 
> - Points 
> - Settings

**Profile**

> - You can now change the rank card colours using `k!profile colour <colour>` 
> - Currently working on features to change opacity/background image.

**New features**

> - `k!settings` - Check all the current server settings. 
> - Cooldown for commands now applies to all commands (3 seconds cooldown) instead of individual commands 
> - Added more aliases for commands

**Bug fixes**

> - Fixed issue where occasionally leaderboard wouldn't show up 
> - Fixed issues where embeds have the wrong colour
> - Changed information/layout of various embeds
> - `k!reset all` has been changed to `k!reset settings`
> - Fixed issue with embeds not showing up when there is no user/guild avatar.

**Future updates**

This weeks features have been pretty slow, but I've been working on some fun stuff for servers. Hopefully within the next week or two, I'll be releasing `koth`. You'll be able to start a temporary leaderboard, and add rewards for the winners whenever the leaderboard is reset!!
